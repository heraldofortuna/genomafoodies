## Comments

- Is my first time using GraphQL, so probably, my Apollo Client implementation is very basic.

- Due to the design, I couldn't use the router hook so I assumed that I had to create conditionals regarding the screen width.

- I didn't have time to implement the loading functionality for the first 5 characters. My apologies.
